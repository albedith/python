#improving_the_index.py

# The current index includes a url in the list of urls
# for a keyword multiple times if the keyword appears
# on that page more than once.

# It might be better to only include the same url
# once in the url list for a keyword, even if it appears
# many times.

# Modify add_to_index so that a given url is only
# included once in the url list for a keyword,
# no matter how many times that keyword appears.
