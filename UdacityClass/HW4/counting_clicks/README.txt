# One way search engines rank pages
# is to count the number of times a
# searcher clicks on a returned link.
# This indicates that the person doing
# the query thought this was a useful
# link for the query, so it should be
# higher in the rankings next time.

# (In Unit 6, we will look at a different
# way of ranking pages that does not depend
# on user clicks.)

# Modify the index such that for each url in a
# list for a keyword, there is also a number
# that counts the number of times a user
# clicks on that link for this keyword.

# The result of lookup(index,keyword) should
# now be a list of url entries, where each url
# entry is a list of a url and a number
# indicating the number of times that url
# was clicked for this query keyword.

# You should define a new procedure to simulate
# user clicks for a given link:

# record_user_click(index,word,url)

# that modifies the entry in the index for
# the input word by increasing the count associated
# with the url by 1.

# You also will have to modify add_to_index
# in order to correctly create the new data
# structure, and to prevent the repetition of
# entries as in homework 4-5.
