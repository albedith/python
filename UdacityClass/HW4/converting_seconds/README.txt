#converting_seconds

# Write a procedure, convert_seconds, which takes as input a non-negative
# number of seconds and returns a string of the form
# '<integer> hours, <integer> minutes, <number> seconds' but
# where if <integer> is 1 for the number of hours or minutes,
# then it should be hour/minute. Further, <number> may be an integer
# or decimal, and if it is 1, then it should be followed by second.
# You might need to use int() to turn a decimal into a float depending
# on how you code this. int(3.0) gives 3
#
# Note that English uses the plural when talking about 0 items, so
# it should be "0 minutes".
